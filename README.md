### ***Description***
#### Minesweepers is a simple but challenging game. Players click on a square to reveal that square. That square may hide a mine or not. If a square does not have a mine, it will show a number that identifies how many mines are directly adjacent to it. 
#### You lose if you click on a hidden mine. You win if you reveal all squares without a mine!
